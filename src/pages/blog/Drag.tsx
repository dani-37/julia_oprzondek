            "Gay men are opinionated. Drag queens are opinionated. Artists are opinionated. 
            Put it all together, it’s like a ticking bomb."

            To succeed in the drag world, you need to commit your whole self. And during his first two
            years, Ian Gill did anything he had to do. After graduating from Virginia Commonwealth
            University, he got a job in administration at his alma mater with “salary and benefits, and all
            that crap.” But at the same time, he had his drag job - so, he worked 20 hours a day. “I would
            go straight from work to do the show, finish it at 3am in the city, drive home from the city,
            and then drive back and be back at work at 7am.”
        </p>
        <p>
            After one of his bosses, who “weren’t very good people,” made a suicidal joke, he deemed it
            a sign from the universe: “This is the time to just quickly give in your resignation and get
            going.” And so, about a month ago, he quit.
        </p>
        <p>
            We managed to meet while he was visiting his family. In a small café in North London, he
            reminisced about his drag journey and was as honest as one can be.
            At 23 years old, he is a full-time drag queen. His stage alter ego is London Lestrange, named
            partly as a reference to his British upbringing, and partly as an ironic take on London Tipton,
            a character from ‘Suite Life of Zack and Cody,’ the 2000’s Disney Channel series. “In the
            show, she is rich and beautiful but stupid. I wanted to create a character that was pretty but
            intelligent as well,” he explained. “I wanted to give that name a different meaning. And
            Lestrange is, of course, from Harry Potter.
        </p>
        <p>    
            ”His drag beginnings weren’t easy. He admitted having no memory of his first live show: “I
            totally blacked out and went completely on autopilot.” And although his first performance
            didn’t herald a bright drag career, things have been going “really well so far.”
            In drag, he is not afraid of being himself and doesn’t follow the trends. As an example, while
            most queens use bright neon colours to gain attention, he limits himself to red, black and
            white. These were his favourite childhood colours which he now made his “brand.”
            He is currently a regular performer at Godfrey’s, the bar which is the American drag mecca,
            located in Richmond, Virginia. It is a place where the industry is flourishing. “We have a ton
            of queens here. It’s a blooming and oversaturated situation at the moment. It’s quite
            competitive.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Social media is to blame for that. It introduced drag culture to a new audience and gave rise
            to a new generation of performers. “If somebody wanted to do drag, anyone can do it. It’s
            both a blessing and a curse.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The increased presence of drag performers on both social media and television slowly
            changed the stigma around this craft. But it also led to disagreements between the old and
            new school of drag. “Lots of the new girls disregard and discredit all the people who have
            come before us and created this path that we can now revel in.”
        </p>
        <p>
            What also leads to tensions is the confidence, colourfulness and outspokenness of the
            performers. “Gay men, in general, are opinionated. Drag queens are opinionated, Artists areopinionated. Put it all together, it’s a ticking bomb,” he said, laughing. “But it’s an art form.
            And in any art form, some people have some strong feelings, and have a need to speak”
            Gill, on the other hand, has a different attitude to such disagreements. After one drag queen
            criticised him online for wearing too little make-up, he kindly answered: “Thank you for the
            critique. Have a nice day.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, with his life revolving around drag, he is living his best life - but it’s not the easiest,
            as he frankly admitted. “Because of constant performing, I’m in a lot of pain. I’m sore, I’m
            exhausted. There are days when it’s a real, real job. But for the most part, it’s a pretty good
            time.”

        A profile of London Ian McGill, known professionally as London Lestrange. He is based in Richmond, Virginia, and told me about the local drag culture and how he gained confidence in his craft.

        <p className='font-aptos font-thin text-sm'>
        It was one of my favourite pieces because I got to explore a topic that I was personally interested in. Having watched many drag shows, I knew how much work goes into the costumes, gigs, and their stage presence. 
        </p>
        <p className='font-aptos font-thin text-sm -mb-8'>
        That is exactly why I chose to write about it for my Feature Writing class in my second year of university. With RuPaul’s Drag Race coming to the UK in 2019, I wanted to bring the drag craft to the readers and shed a spotlight on the dedication required from the performers.
