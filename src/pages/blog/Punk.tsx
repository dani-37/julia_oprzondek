            Punk, growing up, and staying yourself

            It is the early 1970s, Paul Hollins is a teenager and takes the casual 25-minute train ride to Leeds from his hometown Harrogate. But this time, he is going to a concert by a new band with his friends. He is excited but doesn’t know what to expect. It turns out this “small band nobody heard of” was Sex Pistols.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paul is one of many who devoted their teenage years to bands like Sex Pistols and, essentially, punk music. Mohawks, Vivienne Westwood fashion, Doc Martens, and bootleg albums. Anti-establishment youth who advocated for individual freedom. That is what the era was about. Currently known for its strong political outlook, anti-consumerism and anti-corporatism, punk has evolved a great deal in the first decade of its existence. Paul Hollins, now 59, recalls that at the beginning of the 1970s, the subculture was not political in the traditional meaning of the word. Coming from Harrogate, a “strange and conservative town,” which was a bit posh (though, he says, no one was aware of it at the time), punk gave him a feeling of freedom.

            “It was political in the sense that it was an expression of breaking out of certain social conditions that were around,” he says. “We didn’t feel we had a voice, and this group gave it to us.” Dr Victor Avilla Torres, Associate Lecturer in Sociology at the University of York, points out that any subculture has its own time and space. “There is a set of reasons that lead to the creation of a group,” he describes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from the initial adoration for fashion and music, the late 1970s were filled with resistance and discontent about the surrounding world. According to a survey conducted by Fifty magazine on subcultures and their impact on people’s lives, 17% of respondents said they sought political allies by joining a community.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of the decade, punk had transformed into a socio-political movement. John Addison, 55, admits that for him it was very much a political stance. “At gatherings, there were leaflets full of information that encouraged action. Also, punk music itself had a strong political subtext,” he says. “I liked to analyse lyrics, so that also got me more into politics.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Punk thrived throughout the 1970s and later split up into various genres, like new wave, Oi! or new romantic. But did the intense belonging to the first rush of punk have an impact on its members' later lives?
        </p>
        <p>
            Survey respondents agree on what has been (and continues to be) influenced the most. An overwhelming 34% said their social life flourishes to this day thanks to the scene they joined. Surprisingly though, professional and academic lives placed second and third, respectively. Paul is a fitting example of that. Nowadays, he is a Professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Bolton and admits it was punk that led him into that professional direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I have been in academia for a long time. Some years ago, perhaps a little less now, it allowed you to express your concerns by writing papers or doing research,” he says. “So, in terms of my career, I joined an area where I had a voice; and that was the message that punk was always trying to convey.”
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, Paul’s love for the music and art scene also infiltrated his profession. He is the director and trustee of the Leeds Conservatoire, as well as a chair of galleries and museums trust. “Now, I have that musical interest professionally, and it definitely came out of punk,” he admits proudly. His constant affiliation to punk is well-visible during our interview, where beneath his shirt, he is wearing a tee with the “I Am a Cliché” album cover, a song by the 1970s punk band, X-Rey Spex.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, 21% of respondents indicated that their family life has also been influenced by their subculture belonging. However, the differences between generations can lead to funny misunderstandings. John has four daughters but has never desperately tried to teach them about punk. He recalls a moment when his eldest daughter came home wearing a Sex Pistols shirt. “She was looking quite provocative, and I thought ‘Oh great, now I have to burn it,’” he says laughing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Other time she declared: ‘I’m listening to a band that is really extreme, you won’t know it, dad.’ And it turned out to be the Misfits… When I told her, I saw them three times, she could not believe it,” he recounts. “But then she got a Coldplay CD, and I was horrified. So, it’s kind of a joke but I think it strengthens the relationships around me.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, identifying with a specific scene is not as common when people reach their 50s, which leads to critique from the outside world. According to our survey, more than 85% of people feel judged by their peers for being a part of a subculture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The respondents have been very honest about their experience. They list various reasons as to why people may look down on them. “We are perceived as too political and needing to grow up,” “people are jealous of my large social circle of risk-takers,” or simply “it’s ignorance”.
        </p>
        <p>
            “People still have these stereotypes from the 1970s, that it was very nihilistic or violent,” John says. “And it’s quite amusing since most of us were not violent at all. I was a pacifist, a peace protester.” He tells a story about his friend from Los Angeles, Paul Rogers, 55, who plays bass in The Wraith, an LA Death Rock band (one of the many sub-genres that emerged from punk), and has people constantly tell him he is too old to be in a band.
        </p>
        <p>
            “But he started doing this when he was 13 and people said he was too young, and now they say he’s too old,” John narrates. “It almost seems like you can do it between the ages of 15 to 25, and then you have to grow up. You just can’t please everyone.” Dr Avilla Torres suggests that this is what happens with subcultures by nature. “By its own definition, such groups will be in a position of challenging the mainstream culture,” he points out. “So, to people on the outside, it is always going to be something irregular.”
        </p>
        <p>
            But despite this judgement, according to 97% of respondents, subcultures turned out to be of immense help during lockdowns. More than 88% of people have engaged in online activities in their communities. They mention numerous examples, from social media to book-sharing and discussing issues like the Black Lives Matter protests, to the publishing of fanzines (a non-professional publication whose name comes from a blend of words “fan” and “magazine”). Subcultures have their own code, a way of communicating. People find it easier to seek support from friends within a specific group because there is a shared identity and affinity. It helps at times when more understanding and empathy are needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Community, in general, is helpful, but especially during a global pandemic,” says Dr Avilla Torres. “People can express their needs. And it is safer to do so amongst like-minded people.” So, while people may still be prejudiced towards subcultures like punk, all it might take is opening their minds to different ways of living.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I would suggest stepping out of the media brainwash and thinking for yourself,” says John. “Punk is all about thinking for yourself. People wonder why we don’t grow out of it, but in reality, we grow up with it.” As one of the survey respondents concluded: “For as long as there is alterophobia, the communities within subcultures will remain important cornerstones for people’s happiness. They can save lives.”

        In 2018, for one of my final classes at City, I worked on a magazine supposed to answer to a niche in the market. Eventually, with my team, we decided to target people in their fifties with a magazine (fittingly) titled Fifty.  
        </p>
        <p className='font-aptos font-thin text-sm'>
        Amongst others, it featured one of my investigative features about former punk fans and where they are now. My conversations with several interviewees went beyond one music genre, though; their focal point was the value of subcultures for their communities. 
        </p>
        <p className='font-aptos font-thin text-sm -mb-8'>
        After finding most interviewees online, it was wonderful to have total strangers open up to me about some of the most formative years of their lives and see where their journey took them.
