        The Lambert was a quarterly student magazine set up as a project of the Federation of Polish Student Societies in the UK. It featured voices from the community, focusing on social, economic, technological, cultural, and political issues while serving as a forum for discussion and exchange of views.

        Our team consisted of six people and I was responsible for the graphic design. It was a challenge at first since I hadnâ€™t done that on a larger scale before, but with every issue that came out, I became more confident in my communication skills. And while I know I have since learned much more about graphic design (and now look at some of my aesthetic choices with a slight chuckle), I find my involvement with The Lambert in this project to be one of the more formative in my creative journey.

        In the end, I was a part of the team for almost two years and in that time worked on eight themed issues: shaping the future, identity, community, love, heritage, modern revolutions, and virtual realities. Below are some of my favourite covers and layouts I made for the magazine.
