            The Lambert was a quarterly student magazine set up as a project of the Federation of Polish Student Societies in the UK. It featured voices from the community, focusing on social, economic, technological, cultural, and political issues while serving as a forum for discussion and exchange of views.

            Our team consisted of six people and I was responsible for the graphic design. It was a challenge at first since I hadnâ€™t done that on a larger scale before, but with every issue that came out, I became more confident in my abilities (specifically regarding Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and After Effects). And while I know I have learned much more since I find my involvement in this project to be one of the more formative in my creative journey.

            In the end, I was a part of the team for almost two years and in that time worked on eight themed issues: shaping the future, identity, community, love, heritage, modern revolutions, and virtual realities
