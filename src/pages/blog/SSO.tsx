      In 2024, I was the host of She Sounds Off, a show on Islington Radio,
      highlighting female voices and musicians on the London and global music
      scenes. Creatring weekly episodes and sharing valuable music and artists
      that cut through the radio noise was incredibly exciting. NB: It is the
      hosts that sounded off, not the musicians featured in the show.
    </p>
    <p className="  font-thin text-sm">
      Creating a safe space for female voices is very important to me. I do
      understand the glass ceilings that women and minorities have to face in
      the music industry, and being able to contribute to the changing of the
      status quo (albeit on a small scale) was very fulfilling.
    </p>
    <p className="  font-thin text-sm -mb-8">
      Apart from hosting and choosing the tracklist, I also edited the episodes
      and created the showâ€™s visual identity online.
