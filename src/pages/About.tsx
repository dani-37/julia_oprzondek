                            Hi! I'm Julia. I have always been fascinated by different media and how they can be used to enhance the stories they present. In my jobs and passion projects, I have long been trying to learn about as many media forms as I can â€” to get a thorough overview of what can be done.

                            Because of this, I am deeply rooted in the creative industry. Apart from experience, you can read about below, I managed to dive deeper even into these fields during my degrees in Journalism and Management of Arts & Culture. After these five years, I bring a distinctive perspective to my work, blending creativity with strategic communications and management.

                            My goal is to one day be in a position that would allow me to create projects and campaigns about important world issues through art, music, the written word, and emerging media. I am particularly interested in gender equality, climate change action, access to education, and equal representation. Combining those with my love for art and culture would be a dream.
